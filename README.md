# FitConnect

In the realm of fitness tracking, while Fitbit offers extensive capabilities for individual users, as of 2024, its platforms lack robust features for organizations like the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) to efficiently monitor the performance of multiple recruits through a unified dashboard.

To address this gap, FitConnect emerges as a pragmatic solution. Leveraging Fitbit's API capabilities, FitConnect integrates seamlessly with Fitbit's ecosystem, enabling SAF commanders to monitor the health and progress of their recruits in real-time.

At its core, FitConnect utilizes a secure SQL Database to store and manage user data. Powered by Node.js, FitConnect facilitates communication with Fitbit's API, ensuring commanders have access to accurate information at all times.

On the frontend, FitConnect offers a user-friendly interface built with React.js. Tailored for SAF commanders, the interface visualizes recruit performance metrics, including activity levels, sleep patterns, and heart rate data. Commanders can navigate personalized dashboards to gain insights and optimize training regimes.

FitConnect represents a practical approach to organizational fitness tracking, providing commanders with valuable insights to support decision-making and enhance fitness outcomes for recruits.
